**Architecture revision:** `docs/v0.8.0/08-navigation-platform-revision.md`  
**Catalog specification:** `docs/v0.8.0/10-catalog-specification.md`  
**Implementation plan v2:** `docs/v0.8.0/09-implementation-plan-v2.md`

## Shipped — v0.7.1 Initiative Management

| Phase | Deliverable | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| F11 / Phase 0 | Initiative management foundation (types, API, shared form state) | **Completed** |
| F12 | Create Initiative dialog + list integration | **Completed** — manual QA passed |
| F13 | Edit Initiative dialog (list + detail), metadata panel, date/lifecycle rules | **Completed** — manual QA passed |
| F14 | Initiative Lifecycle Management (dedicated actions, confirmations, backend enforcement) | **Completed** — manual QA passed (PR #42) |
| F15 | Delete Initiative | **Completed** — manual QA passed (PR #43) |

**F13 business rules finalized:**

- **Create:** Start date must be today (UTC) or later; expiry on or after start
- **Edit — unchanged start date:** Stored start date preserved (even if in the past); other fields editable without forced date change
- **Edit — modified start date:** New start must be today (UTC) or later; backdating rejected
- **Expired lifecycle (via Mark Expired action):** Expiry date auto-set to today (UTC); status-aware banners (Draft — none; Active — countdown; Expired — "Expired", never "Expires in X days")
- **Field limits:** Title 100, description 2000, reward 500 characters

**F14 lifecycle business rules finalized:**

- **Status is read-only** throughout the application; removed from Create/Edit forms
- **Lifecycle transitions** only via dedicated actions: Publish, Return to Draft, Mark Expired, Reactivate
- **Transition matrix:**
  - DRAFT → ACTIVE (Publish)
  - ACTIVE → DRAFT (Return to Draft)
  - ACTIVE → EXPIRED (Mark Expired)
  - EXPIRED → ACTIVE (Reactivate)
  - **Blocked:** DRAFT → EXPIRED, EXPIRED → DRAFT, any status change via metadata PUT
- **Publish:** Full metadata validation before transition; employees gain access per configured start date
- **Return to Draft:** Allowed even with existing submissions; preserves submissions, approvals, leaderboard, and audit history; employees hidden immediately; no new submissions while Draft
- **Mark Expired:** Expiry set to today (UTC); employees lose access immediately; existing submissions preserved
- **Reactivate:** Expiry must be ≥ today (UTC) and ≥ start date; intended for reopening the same initiative cohort (not recurring yearly programs)
- **Backend endpoints:** `POST /publish`, `/return-to-draft`, `/mark-expired`, `/reactivate`

**Also delivered (v0.7.1 stack):** App-wide long-text display standard; Flyway V10/V11 initiative constraints

**F15 delete business rules finalized:**

- Delete eligibility depends only on certificate submission count (`0` = allowed, `>0` = blocked)
- Hard delete only; backend validates before delete; HTTP 409 when blocked
- Admin list + detail delete actions; blocked informational dialog or confirmation dialog
- Employees never see delete controls; lifecycle actions unchanged

### Phase 2 — Edit Profile (PR #27)

- `PUT /api/v1/profile` — update full name and email
- Email change issues new JWT via `accessToken` in response
- `ProfileEditForm` with dirty-form guard and snackbar feedback
- `AuthProvider.refreshProfile()` for session sync

### Phase 3 — Change Password Entry (PR #27)

- **Download Template** — header-only CSV from toolbar
- **Create-only import** — new users only; default password with forced change on first login
- **Upload lockdown** — controls disabled during preview/import
- **Result summary** — imported/failed counts and per-row errors; list refresh on success

### Import quality fixes (PRs #23, #24)

- **Blank row parser improvements** — skip trailing empty CSV/Excel rows
